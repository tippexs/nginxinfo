Version `0.0.1 alpha`

Helping NGINX users migrate from NGINX OSS to Plus.

We want to make it easier for customers using NGINX open source to upgrade safely and easily to NGINX Plus.

## Build / Installation

The tool does not require any 3rd-party software or modules. The shell-script generated by the `build.py` script can be directly copied and executed on the target server.

To build the shell script clone the repository and create a virtual-environment
`python3 -m venv nginxinfo` and activate `source nginxinfo/bin/activate`. Install the dependencies for the build script.

`python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Make the python build.py script executable.
`chmod +x ./build.py` 

#### Build the shell script
` ./build.py > nginxinfo.sh && chmod +x nginxinfo.sh`

The generated shell script can be copied to the server and executed.

## Run
Currently we support 3 runtime modes.
- quite (`-q`) will print nothing but return an exit-code
- normal (default) will print only important information for the upgrade.
- debug / verbose (`-v`). Will print the parsing output as well as all information printed in the normal mode.

#### Example output
```shell

(nginxinfo)$ ./nginxinfo.sh

## ToDos

- More NGINX Version Information (source branch, release date)
- Calculate an Upgrade-Score based on different information(Operating system, unknown directives and / or modules)
- Scanning a `nginx -T` output and print a report.
- Handle runtime information from /proc/PID/cmdline instead of `nginx -V`
- Detect unsupported builds and modules (dynamic and static)
